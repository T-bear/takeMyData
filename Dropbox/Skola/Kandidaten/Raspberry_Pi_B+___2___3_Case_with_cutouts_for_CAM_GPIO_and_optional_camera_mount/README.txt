# Summary

Hi all,  
this is another modified version of Walters's great Raspberry Pi 2/B+ case (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:604915). I changed some dimensions for a better fit since the original model was too tight (it worked, but I was afraid of ripping my Pi apart when removing the case).  
Additionally there are cutouts f√ºr GPIO and for the camera connector, as well as an optional camera housing on a ball joint giving many possibilities for positioning. The camera mount is fully optional and requires a DIN 912 M3x10 screw (or similar). You have to drill a hole (2,5 mm) for the screw to attach the joint to the case. The small hole in the camera housing is for positioning and drilling a 6 mm hole for nice fit on the ball joint.  It is intended to have the camera housing legs bended a bit for good fit. Btw. the camera mount is independent of the case and can be used with everything, you can cut a thread in.  
  
The images attached are the results of printing the model on a Reprap Neo in PLA, 0,2 mm layer height and 0,5 mm nozzle.  I hope the models turn out usefull for some of you!   

Update: Camera pin was too big for some so added a smaller one.
Update 2: Added Model with cutouts for DSI, Camera and GPIO (a standard 40 pin IDE connector fits), but please be aware, that it might be only properly printable with support enabled.

# Instructions

The case without camera mount works out of the box.  

The camera mount requires the following finishing work:  
- one DIN 912 M3x10 screw  
- drill one 2,5 mm hole somewhere on the pi case for the screw  
- drill two 6 mm holes in the camera housing legs for nice fit on the ball joint (if it's too tight try drilling bigger holes)  
- drill one 3,5 mm hole in the ball joint for the screw and a 6 mm cutting for the screw head (be careful not to cut too deep)
